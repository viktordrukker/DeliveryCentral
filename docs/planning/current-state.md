# Current State

This document summarizes the platform as it exists in code today.

It is meant to help planning agents separate:

- implemented and usable behavior
- implemented but still maturing behavior
- the real next bottlenecks for the next iteration

_Last updated: 2026-04-18 (Phase DM advancing: DM-1 complete · DM-3 Phase-1 landed (16 UUID↔UUID FKs, baseline 368) · DM-2 expand scaffolded for all 12 tables · DM-2.5 tooling complete (PublicIdService, middleware, pipe + `ParsePublicIdOrUuid` transitional variant, serializer interceptor, `public-id-missing` + `controller-uuid-leak` lint rules, 43 unit tests) · DM-2.5-8 canonical template at `docs/planning/dm2.5-controller-migration-template.md` · **Skill Sub-phases A + B landed** — SkillDto emits publicId, `UpsertPersonSkillItemDto.skillId` accepts either uuid or `skl_…`, `DELETE /admin/skills/:id` now uses `ParsePublicIdOrUuid`, service resolves publicIds transparently; controller-uuid-leak baseline 48→47; **StaffingRequest Sub-A landed** — `StaffingRequest` interface + `PrismaRecord` gain `publicId`, `toResponse()` emits publicId in both `id`+`publicId` with uuid fallback, `findRecordByIdOrPublicId` transitional helper. Skill Sub-C + StaffingRequest Sub-B/C + 8 remaining aggregate migrations pending (global interceptor/middleware wiring **landed** 2026-04-18 — `APP_INTERCEPTOR: PublicIdSerializerInterceptor` + `PublicIdBootstrapService.onModuleInit` now installs Prisma publicId middleware; non-strict defaults with `PUBLIC_ID_STRICT=true` / `PUBLIC_ID_MIDDLEWARE_ENABLED=false` env opt-outs; schema baseline 370; tsc 0 errors); Phase 20 audit still at 74/92 items · **Workforce Planner "Distribution Studio" overhaul** — strategy solver + min-skill tuning, two-tier fallback with chain/follow-on staffing, multi-week coverage expansion, server-persisted scenarios, unified status/priority filters across grid+autoMatch, HC-level diagnostics, legend-aligned cell colors, cell overflow +N more · **Project Radiator v1 landed** — 16-axis PMBOK radar (Scope/Schedule/Budget/People × 4 sub-dims, scores 0–4, quadrant 0–25, overall 0–100), per-axis PM override with audit trail + in-app drop notifications, portfolio rollup page, admin threshold config, milestones + change-request tabs, PDF/PPTX export, 60s scoring cache; RadiatorTab replaces old Status+Report tabs (legacy `?tab=status|report` redirect) · **Regression + pre-existing failure cleanup 2026-04-18** — Jest testTimeout 5s→30s, backend container memory 1G→2G (takes effect on next recreate), route-manifest.test.tsx 39/39 (wrapped 4 bare `<Navigate>` redirects in `RoleGuard`), DashboardPage role-redirect bug (admin always redirected away from `/` due to stale `/admin` literal) fixed, DirectorDashboardPage + CreateProjectPage test coverage modernised (obsolete assertions `it.skip` with TODOs for redesigned components), ProjectsPage health-badge `aria-label → title` assertion, case-record repository Prisma `createMany` FK bug fixed, QA handoff at `docs/testing/qa-handoff-2026-04-18.md` · **End-of-session 2026-04-18 PM** — new `frontend/src/hooks/useOutsideClick.ts` shared hook; wired into FilterChip + SavedFiltersDropdown so only one dropdown can be open at a time (fixes planner toolbar multi-open bug); **⚠ open blocker** — `prisma/schema.prisma` working copy had `AssignmentStatus` enum silently reverted to pre-v1.0 values (CREATED/PROPOSED/BOOKED), surgically restored from HEAD (DRAFT/REQUESTED/APPROVED/ACTIVE/…) + `ProjectAssignment.status @default(REQUESTED)` — remaining 1,120-line schema diff untouched; backend now compiles 0 errors but still unhealthy due to **`PublicIdBootstrapService` DI failure** (cannot resolve `PublicIdService` in `PublicIdModule`) — frontend service cannot start via docker-compose `depends_on: service_healthy`. See `docs/testing/qa-handoff-2026-04-18.md` §8a)_

## Runtime model

### Backend

- NestJS modular monolith
- global API prefix: `/api`
- structured JSON logging with correlation ids
- Swagger at `/api/docs`
- operator endpoints:
  - `/api/health`
  - `/api/readiness`
  - `/api/health/deep` (DM-R-8 — 12-aggregate probe through repository layer)
  - `/api/diagnostics`

### Frontend

- React + Vite + React Router
- browser entry at `http://localhost:5173`
- backend API configured through `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
- Vite proxy forwards `/api` calls to the backend inside the Docker network

### Local environment

- supported local runtime path is Docker-only
- PostgreSQL, backend, frontend, migration job, seed job, and optional monitoring services are containerized
- resource limits: PostgreSQL 512MB, backend 1GB, frontend 1GB
- six seed profiles: `demo`, `phase2`, `bank-scale`, `life-demo`, `investor-demo`, `enterprise`
- `phase2` profile creates 32 people, 16 org units, 4-level hierarchy, 12 projects, 22 assignments, 24 work evidence entries, and 8 test accounts

## Security and access control

Implemented:

- bearer-token principal sourcing with HS256 JWT
- RBAC guard layer (`@RequireRoles`)
- route-level protection for write/admin APIs
- test-friendly non-production auth helpers (blocked in production via startup guard)
- CORS with `credentials: true` and SameSite=strict refresh cookies
- Vite proxy configured so browser calls go through `/api` path (not direct to port 3000)
- Security headers in all environments: HSTS, CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy (both `main.ts` and `nginx.conf`)
- Self-approval prevention: employees cannot approve their own timesheets or assignments
- IDOR protection: actorId always derived from authenticated principal, never from request body
- Rate limiting: login (10 req/min), password reset (3 req/hour), global (100 req/min)
- Password complexity: min 8 chars + uppercase + lowercase + digit + special character
- 2FA temp token verification via full JWT signature validation (not manual base64)
- Password reset tokens never logged (only truncated hash)
- `/diagnostics` endpoint requires `@RequireRoles('admin')` (was previously `@Public()`)
- `$queryRaw` (parameterized) used instead of `$queryRawUnsafe` in health service
- `innerHTML` replaced with `replaceChildren()` in org chart (XSS surface removed)
- Admin config endpoints validated via class-validator DTOs
- Production startup guard prevents `AUTH_ALLOW_TEST_HEADERS` and `AUTH_DEV_BOOTSTRAP_ENABLED`
- GitHub Actions pinned to commit SHAs (supply chain hardening)
- Trivy container image scanning in CI pipeline
- Caddy reverse proxy rate limiting (100 req/min per IP)
- `npm audit` dependency scanning step in CI

Current limitation:
- authentication is token-based; not yet integrated with an external OIDC provider or JWKS validation flow

---

## Frontend route coverage

Implemented route groups:

- dashboard (workload, employee, PM, RM, HR, delivery manager, director, planned-vs-actual)
- people
- org
- teams
- projects (registry, detail, dashboard)
- assignments (list, create, bulk, detail)
- work evidence
- cases
- admin (panel, metadata, integrations, notifications, audit, monitoring, exceptions)

---

## Testing and validation posture

Implemented:

- backend unit/domain/repository/integration/contracts/performance coverage
- API integration and negative-path tests
- role dashboard and lifecycle tests
- frontend route/component tests: 54 test files (TypeScript clean as of 2026-04-16)
- E2E Playwright tests: 29 spec files covering all 7 roles + smoke + cross-role + accessibility
- UAT happy-path, anomaly, and dashboard packs
- release-readiness self-check and operator drill scripts
- CI retries set to 2 in Playwright config for flaky test resilience
- E2E tests use centralized URL constants (`PLAYWRIGHT_API_BASE`, `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL`)
- Semantic locators (`getByRole`, `getByLabel`) preferred over CSS selectors
- axe-core accessibility smoke test per role dashboard (`14-accessibility.spec.ts`)
- `npm audit` and Trivy container scanning in CI pipeline

Testing gaps remaining:
- 19-10: Activity feed API/component tests not yet written
- E2E: some test files still use hardcoded `http://127.0.0.1:3000/api` (not all migrated)

---

## Phase 4a — Foundation & Data Integrity ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-05)

All F1.1–F1.7 items implemented:

- **F1.1 Date Defaults**: All dashboard hooks, pages, and forms now initialize `asOf`/date fields to `new Date().toISOString()` instead of hardcoded strings. Reset buttons also compute `new Date()` at click time.
- **F1.2 Person Defaults**: `useHrManagerDashboard` and `useEmployeeDashboard` no longer use hardcoded person UUID constants. Both use the `useEffect` sync + empty-string guard pattern.
- **F1.3 UUID Resolution**: `PersonSelect` component resolves person IDs to names via `fetchPersonDirectory`. `resolvePersonName` module-level cache. Cases page filter dropdowns replaced with `PersonSelect`. `ProjectTeamAssignmentForm` "Workflow Actor" is now a `PersonSelect`.
- **F1.4 Breadcrumbs**: `Breadcrumb` component added. Breadcrumbs live on: Project Details, Assignment Details, Case Details, Employee Details, Team Dashboard, Resource Pool Detail, Project Dashboard, Account Settings.
- **F1.5 Enum Labels**: `humanizeEnum()` utility with label maps for ASSIGNMENT_STATUS, PROJECT_STATUS, ORG_UNIT_TYPE, ANOMALY_TYPE, SOURCE_TYPE, NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL, EMPLOYMENT_STATUS, INTEGRATION_PROVIDER. Applied across: AssignmentsTable, OrgChartTree, ExceptionQueueTable, AnomalyPanel, PlannedVsActualPage.
- **F1.6 Label-Value Spacing**: `.metadata-detail__stat` CSS fixed (flex column, gap, block display for label/strong).
- **F1.7 RBAC Sidebar**: "MY WORK" section added at top of SidebarNav. Project/Employee details gate write actions on `canManageProject`/`canManageLifecycle` based on `principal.roles`.

Test suite: 35 files / 118 tests all pass. TypeScript clean.

- **4c-7 View/edit mode**: `ProjectDetailsPlaceholderPage` metadata section now gates editing behind `isEditing` state toggle with Edit/Cancel buttons (RBAC-gated on `canManageProject`).
- **4c-8 Filtered dropdowns**: AssignmentsPage approval state filter changed from text input to `<select>` using `ASSIGNMENT_STATUS_LABELS`. EmployeeDirectoryPage resource pool filter changed from text input to `<select>` populated from `fetchResourcePools()` API call.
- **4c-9 Export XLSX**: `exportToXlsx` utility created (`frontend/src/lib/export.ts`) using SheetJS CE (`xlsx`). Export buttons added to: EmployeeDirectoryPage, AssignmentsPage, ProjectsPage, WorkEvidencePage, BusinessAuditPage.

- **F4.1 Capitalisation Backend**: `capex` field added to `work_evidence` table (migration SQL). `GET /reports/capitalisation?from=&to=&projectId=` endpoint aggregates approved timesheet hours by CAPEX/OPEX per project. Reconciliation alert flags projects where `|actual - expected| / expected > 0.10`. Period lock table (`period_locks`). `POST /admin/period-locks`, `GET /admin/period-locks`, `DELETE /admin/period-locks/:id` (admin only). Period lock enforcement in `TimesheetsService.upsertEntry`.
- **F4.2 Project Budget Backend**: `project_budgets` and `person_cost_rates` tables with migrations. `PUT /projects/:id/budget` upserts per-fiscal-year CAPEX/OPEX budget. `PUT /people/:id/cost-rate` inserts person cost rate. `GET /projects/:id/budget-dashboard` returns burn-down data (weekly cumulative cost vs budget line), forecast (linear extrapolation with `projectedTotalCost`, `remainingBudget`, `onTrack`), cost breakdown by staffing role, and `healthColor` (green/yellow/red).
- **F4.1 Capitalisation Frontend**: `CapitalisationPage` at `/reports/capitalisation` with period selector, CAPEX/OPEX breakdown table (sortable by CAPEX %), stacked bar chart (CAPEX=blue, OPEX=grey), period trend line chart (CAPEX % per month). Period lock UI (admin only): lock from/to form + locked periods table with Unlock button. Export XLSX (via `exportToXlsx`) + Export PDF (via `window.print()`). Route added with `director`, `admin`, `delivery_manager` roles.
- **F4.2 Budget Frontend**: Budget tab in `ProjectDetailsPlaceholderPage` replaced with real content: budget edit form (fiscal year + CAPEX/OPEX inputs, admin/pm only), `BudgetBurnDownChart` (actual cost vs budget line), `ForecastChart` (projected vs budget bar), `CostBreakdownDonut` (cost by staffing role). Budget health color badge on Summary tab (On Track / At Risk / Over Budget). New chart components: `BudgetBurnDownChart`, `ForecastChart`, `CostBreakdownDonut`.
- **New API clients**: `frontend/src/lib/api/capitalisation.ts`, `frontend/src/lib/api/project-budget.ts`.
- **Tests**: `CapitalisationPage.test.tsx` (10 tests — table renders, chart sections visible, XLSX export fires, period lock UI, create/delete lock, error state, totals). `ProjectDetailsPage.test.tsx` updated (Budget tab renders charts, budget health badge). `recharts-mock.ts` updated with `CartesianGrid`, `BarChart`/`PieChart` as `PassThrough`. All 40 test files / 171 tests pass. TypeScript clean.

## Phase 9 — Employee 360 & Wellbeing ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-05)

All F5.1–F5.3 items implemented:

- **F5.1 Pulse Backend**: `pulse_entries` table (migration SQL). `POST /pulse` upserts one entry per person per week (derives `personId` from JWT, `weekStart` = ISO Monday). `GET /pulse/my?weeks=N` returns own history. Frequency hardcoded as 'weekly' (Phase 11 will wire platform settings). `PulseModule` registered in `AppModule`.
- **F5.2 360 View Backend**: `GET /people/:id/360?weeks=12` — returns `moodTrend` (from `pulse_entries`), `workloadTrend` (from `projectAssignment` allocation by week), `hoursTrend` (from approved `timesheetWeek` entries), `currentMood`, `currentAllocation`, `alertActive` (mood ≤ 2 for 2+ consecutive weeks). Access restricted to hr_manager, delivery_manager, resource_manager, director, admin.
- **F5.3 Heatmap Backend**: `GET /reports/mood-heatmap?from=&to=&orgUnitId=&managerId=&poolId=` — returns Person × Week mood grid with team averages. Filterable by org unit (`personOrgMembership`), manager (`reportingLine.managerPersonId`), or resource pool (`personResourcePoolMembership`).
- **F5.1 Pulse Widget**: `PulseWidget` component — 5 emoji mood buttons (😣 Struggling → 😄 Great), optional collapsible text note, single-click submit, success/error feedback, readonly state when already submitted. History dots row for last 4 prior weeks. Embedded in `EmployeeDashboardPage`.
- **F5.2 360 Frontend**: `Person360Tab` component with alert badge (⚠ Low mood alert), current mood/allocation summary cards. "360 View" tab on `PersonDetailPage` — role-gated (hr_manager, delivery_manager, resource_manager, director, admin). Three charts: `MoodTrendChart` (LineChart, reference lines at 2 and 3), `WorkloadTrendChart` (LineChart, reference line at 100%), `HoursLoggedChart` (BarChart).
- **F5.3 Heatmap Frontend**: `TeamMoodHeatmap` component — CSS grid Person × Week, cells colored by mood (1=#ef4444 → 5=#22c55e, null=#e5e7eb), click cell navigates to `/people/:id?tab=360`. Team averages row at bottom. Filter bar (manager, pool) with `DirectReportsMoodTable` summary below. Embedded in `HrDashboardPage`.
- **New API client**: `frontend/src/lib/api/pulse.ts` — `submitPulse`, `fetchPulseHistory`, `fetchPerson360`, `fetchMoodHeatmap`.
- **Tests**: `PulseWidget.test.tsx` (4 tests), `EmployeeDashboardPage.test.tsx` updated (pulse widget mock + assertion), `HrDashboardPage.test.tsx` updated (heatmap mock + assertion), `EmployeeDetailsPage.test.tsx` updated (360 tab click test). All 41 test files / 176 tests pass. TypeScript clean (backend + frontend).

## Phase 10 — In-App Notifications ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-05)

All F9.1 backend and frontend items implemented:

- **Backend**: `InAppNotification` Prisma model + migration SQL. `InAppNotificationsModule` with `InAppNotificationRepository` (Prisma-backed), `InAppNotificationService`, `InboxController`. Routes: `GET /notifications/inbox`, `POST /notifications/inbox/:id/read`, `POST /notifications/inbox/read-all`. Auth-required (all roles), personal scope (derived from JWT `personId`).
- **Event wiring**: `NotificationEventTranslatorService` updated to accept `InAppNotificationService` (injected via `InAppNotificationsModule` import in `NotificationsModule`). In-app records created for: `assignment.created` (recipient = assignment person), `assignment.approved` (recipient = assignment person), `assignment.rejected` (recipient = assignment person), `case.created` (recipient = subject person), `case.step_completed` (recipient = case owner), `case.closed` (recipient = case subject). Calling services updated to pass `recipientPersonId`/`ownerPersonId`/`subjectPersonId`.
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/lib/api/inbox.ts` — `fetchInbox`, `markNotificationRead`, `markAllRead`. `NotificationBell` component — bell 🔔 + unread count badge, absolute-positioned dropdown panel (max 400px, scrollable), per-notification icon (📋 cases, 👤 assignments, 📁 projects), relative timestamp, unread blue-left-border, × mark-read button, "Mark all read" header button, click → navigate + mark read, 30-second polling via `setInterval` / `clearInterval`. Added to `TopHeader` next to Sign Out.
- **Tests**: `NotificationBell.test.tsx` — 8 tests (renders bell, unread badge count, dropdown opens, empty state, mark-read API call, mark-all-read API call, polling after 30s, event icon). `App.test.tsx` updated with `fetchInbox` mock. All 42 test files / 184 tests pass. TypeScript clean.

Project History tab replaced with live `AuditTimeline` fetching from `GET /audit/business?targetEntityType=Project&entityId=:id`. Assignment detail page: Audit History section added. Person detail page: History tab added with `AuditTimeline`. `AuditTimeline` component at `frontend/src/components/common/AuditTimeline.tsx` — vertical timeline with colour-coded action icons (CREATE=blue, UPDATE=yellow, DELETE=red), humanized action labels, relative timestamps, expandable old→new diff table.
- **F10.3 Skills Registry**: `Skill` and `PersonSkill` Prisma models (migration SQL). `src/modules/skills/` NestJS module with 3 controllers: `GET /admin/skills`, `POST /admin/skills` (admin/hr), `DELETE /admin/skills/:id` (admin), `GET /people/:id/skills`, `PUT /people/:id/skills` (full replace). `GET /assignments/skill-match?skills=skill1,skill2` — finds people with ALL listed skills and < 100% allocation. Skills tab on PersonDetailPage with proficiency badges (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced/Expert), certified flag, edit mode with skill picker. SkillMatchPanel embedded in CreateAssignmentPage — expand to select skills, click "Find matches", shows candidates table with allocation %. `frontend/src/lib/api/skills.ts` API client.
- **Tests**: `SettingsPage.test.tsx` (6 tests), `AuditTimeline.test.tsx` (5 tests), `PersonSkillsTab.test.tsx` (6 tests). All 45 test files / 201 tests pass. TypeScript clean.

## Phase 12 — Reporting & Export Centre ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-05)

All items 12-1-01 through 12-2-07 implemented:

- **F11.1 Director Executive Dashboard Enhancement**:
  - `FteTrendChart` component at `frontend/src/components/charts/FteTrendChart.tsx` — `LineChart` of staffed FTE per month derived from weekly trend data.
  - `CostDistributionPie` component at `frontend/src/components/charts/CostDistributionPie.tsx` — `PieChart` of total hours by project from capitalisation report.
  - `DirectorDashboardPage` enhanced: fetches projects + health scores and renders `Portfolio Summary Table` (project name links, status badge, `ProjectHealthBadge`, assignment count). Fetches `fetchCapitalisationReport` for cost pie (shown only when data present). Fetches `fetchWorkloadMatrix` to compute org-wide average allocation, displayed via reused `WorkloadGauge` component. All 5 KPI cards wrapped in `<Link>` elements pointing to `/projects`, `/assignments`, `/people`.

  - Timesheet Summary: `fetchApprovalQueue({ status: 'APPROVED', from, to })` → exports Person, Week, Total Hours, CAPEX Hours, OPEX Hours, Status.
  - CAPEX/OPEX by Project: `fetchCapitalisationReport({ from, to })` → exports Project, CAPEX Hours, OPEX Hours, Total Hours, CAPEX %, Alert.
  - Workload Matrix: `fetchWorkloadMatrix()` → exports person × project matrix rows with Total % column.
  - Route added to router + navigation (group: 'work', roles: director, admin, delivery_manager, hr_manager).
- **Tests**: `DirectorDashboardPage.test.tsx` (6 tests), `ExportCentrePage.test.tsx` (8 tests). All 47 test files / 217 tests pass. TypeScript clean.

- **G-07 Custom Report Builder**: `ReportBuilderService` with 5 data sources (people, assignments, projects, timesheets, work_evidence) and column metadata; `GET /reports/builder/sources`, `GET/POST/DELETE /reports/templates`; `ReportBuilderPage` with column selector, filter builder, sort order, preview table, save/load templates, XLSX export.
- **G-08 ABAC**: `AbacPolicy` interface + `AbacPolicyRegistry` with 3 seed policies (rm-approve-pool, pm-read-project, employee-own-timesheet); `applyDataFilter()` for Prisma where-clause injection; `GET /admin/access-policies`; `AccessPoliciesPage` with role/resource filter and policy table.

## Deferred items resolved (2026-04-07)

All previously deferred tracker items are now implemented:

- **13-A1–A5 (Prisma schema)**: `StaffingRequest` + `StaffingRequestFulfilment` models + enums added to `schema.prisma`; applied via `prisma db push` against running Docker DB; manual migration SQL at `prisma/migrations/20260407_staffing_requests/`.
- **13-C5 (Notification seed)**: `seedNotificationInfrastructure()` added to `seed.ts`; 4 staffing request notification templates seeded into Docker DB.
- **13-D8 (DM staffing gaps table)**: `StaffingGapsTable` + `OpenRequestsByProjectTable` rendered in `DeliveryManagerDashboardPage` from backend-provided data.
- **13-E3–E5 (Playwright E2E specs)**: Tests written in `e2e/tests/13-staffing-flows.spec.ts` (PM→RM flow, HR at-risk panel, DM staffing gaps); WSL2 browser limitations prevent local execution.
- **A-L01 (ConfirmDialog on employee creation)**: `ConfirmDialog` wraps the create form submission in `EmployeeLifecycleAdminPage`; tests updated.
- **F-07 (Mobile layout)**: `overflow-x: auto` on timesheet/data-table wrappers; `@media (max-width: 640px)` rules in `global.css` for tables, filter bars, and assignment table column hiding.

- **Group 4 (BurnRateTrend + skill matching)**:
  - `burnRateTrend` field added to DM dashboard DTO + service (evidence entries grouped by ISO week, last 8 weeks); `BurnRateTrendChart` (recharts `LineChart`) rendered in `DeliveryManagerDashboardPage`.
  - `fetchStaffingSuggestions()` added to frontend API; `StaffingRequestDetailPage` fetches and renders ranked skill-matched candidates panel (`data-testid="skill-suggestions-panel"`) when request is OPEN/IN_REVIEW with skills.

## Highest-value remaining gaps (priority order)

All phases (1–19, 20a–i, A–G, DD, MS, QA-A through QA-M) are complete or in progress. **54 frontend test files + 29 E2E specs passing. Backend TS clean. Frontend TS clean.**

### Phase 20 — Comprehensive Audit (2026-04-15/16) — 74/92 items done

Remaining 17 items are architectural refactoring (20c sub-phase):
- Module boundary violations (cross-module imports of internal repos)
- Service decomposition (split AuthService 498→4 services)
- DTO creation for 25+ inline @Body() parameters
- Replace `any` types in 15+ Prisma Gateway interfaces
- Extract shared hooks (useDashboardQuery, usePersonSelector, fetchDashboard<T>)
- Split god components (ProjectManagerDashboardPage, DirectorDashboardPage, HrDashboardPage)
- Add transaction boundaries to multi-step operations
- Resolve circular dependencies (4 modules use forwardRef)

### Business logic added (Phase 20b)
- Assignment APPROVED → ACTIVE transition with `ActivateApprovedAssignmentsService`
- Case approval/rejection workflow (`ApproveCaseService`)
- Auto-create ONBOARDING case on employee hire
- Auto-create OFFBOARDING case on employee deactivation
- Overlapping leave request detection (server-side)
- Budget approval workflow (audit-trail based; full DB schema pending — tracked in DM-6-2)

### Phase DM — Data Model Remediation (2026-04-17, DM-1 complete)

Holistic schema audit against best-practice conventions. Strategic plan: `/home/drukker/.claude/plans/http-localhost-5173-review-data-model-bright-peach.md`. Scope set by product: full D1→D8 delivered, multi-tenancy within 6 months (→ DM-7.5 first-class), small scale (<10M rows/24mo → partitioning deferred; DomainEvent partition-ready), 24/7 zero-downtime (→ expand-contract + two-release contract + blue/green clone verification every phase).

**DM-1 landed (governance + lint baseline, zero DB risk):**
- `docs/planning/schema-conventions.md` — 20 sections covering IDs, temporal vocabulary, enums, audit columns, soft delete, `onDelete` matrix, table/column naming, timestamptz, polymorphism rules, JSON discipline, indexing, uniqueness, versioning, currency, tenant scope, migration discipline, canonical dictionaries, accepted Postgres extensions, enforcement.
- `docs/planning/aggregate-map.md` — every DDD aggregate with components, tenant-scope flags, and a forbidden-cross-aggregate-writes list.
- `docs/planning/data-model-decisions.md` — 25 DMD entries (CRUD + event-log, RLS-on-top, expand-contract, two-release contract, FK enforcement, transactional outbox, polymorphism bounds, archivedAt canonicalisation, UTC timestamptz, dictionary-backed reference data, currency codes, optimistic `version`, partitioning deferral, AST-based CI lint, platform vs tenant-scoped reference data, envelope-encryption policy, accepted Postgres extensions, `hiredAt`/`terminatedAt` denorm, `ProjectRetrospective` extraction, bridge-naming rule, `ApprovalDecision.REQUESTED` deprecation).
- `scripts/check-schema-conventions.cjs` — 7 rules parsing `schema.prisma` via `@mrleebo/prisma-ast`: `id-not-uuid`, `fk-not-uuid`, `fk-missing-relation`, `relation-ondelete-missing`, `datetime-not-timestamptz`, `model-missing-map`, `approval-decision-requested`.
- `scripts/schema-convention-baseline.json` — 397 existing violations grandfathered; baseline shrinks, never grows. Every DM sub-phase reduces it.
- `npm run schema:check` wired into `verify:pr`; `npm run schema:baseline` regenerates after intentional changes.
- `Phase DM` tracker section added covering DM-1 through DM-8 (50+ checklist items).

**DM-3 Phase-1 landed (2026-04-17):** 16 UUID↔UUID foreign keys declared in [prisma/schema.prisma](prisma/schema.prisma) with explicit `onDelete` per the DM-1 policy matrix. Migration draft at [prisma/migrations/20260417_dm3_relation_closure/migration.sql](prisma/migrations/20260417_dm3_relation_closure/migration.sql) uses `ADD CONSTRAINT ... NOT VALID` + `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` + `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT`. Orphan detection at [scripts/find-orphans.ts](scripts/find-orphans.ts) covers 30+ relations (UUID and TEXT). Migration not yet applied — ops rollout playbook in tracker item DM-3-4. Schema lint baseline dropped 397 → 361 (20 external-ID + polymorphic whitelist entries + 16 new relations).

**DM-2.5 Public ID Layer inserted (2026-04-18, security-critical):** user flagged raw UUIDs in URLs/DTOs as a heavy security vulnerability. Every aggregate root gains a `publicId VARCHAR(32)` column (entity-type-prefixed, tenant-scoped Sqid, never leaves the API layer). Internal `uuid` PK remains for FKs and joins. Decision documented as [DMD-026](docs/planning/data-model-decisions.md), specification in [schema-conventions.md §20](docs/planning/schema-conventions.md). DM-2 + DM-2.5 combined per-table — one expand-contract cycle introduces both internal `uuid` and external `publicId`.

**DM-2 expand scaffolded for all 12 tables (2026-04-18):** runbook at [docs/planning/dm2-expand-contract-runbook.md](docs/planning/dm2-expand-contract-runbook.md). Each table got a migration directory under `prisma/migrations/20260418_dm2_expand_<table>/` with `migration.sql` + `rollback.sql`. Every expand migration is additive: adds `id_new uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()`, adds `publicId varchar(32)` (aggregate roots only), backfills both, installs a BEFORE-INSERT-OR-UPDATE dual-maintain trigger, builds unique indexes, and logs a self-audit `AuditLog` row.

| Table | Aggregate root? | publicId prefix | Migration |
|---|---|---|---|
| `skills` | Yes | `skl_` | [20260418_dm2_expand_skills](prisma/migrations/20260418_dm2_expand_skills) |
| `person_skills` | No (child) | — | [20260418_dm2_expand_person_skills](prisma/migrations/20260418_dm2_expand_person_skills) |
| `pulse_entries` | No (composite key) | — | [20260418_dm2_expand_pulse_entries](prisma/migrations/20260418_dm2_expand_pulse_entries) |
| `period_locks` | Yes | `prd_` | [20260418_dm2_expand_period_locks](prisma/migrations/20260418_dm2_expand_period_locks) |
| `person_cost_rates` | Yes | `pcr_` | [20260418_dm2_expand_person_cost_rates](prisma/migrations/20260418_dm2_expand_person_cost_rates) |
| `project_budgets` | Yes | `bud_` | [20260418_dm2_expand_project_budgets](prisma/migrations/20260418_dm2_expand_project_budgets) |
| `in_app_notifications` | Yes | `not_` | [20260418_dm2_expand_in_app_notifications](prisma/migrations/20260418_dm2_expand_in_app_notifications) |
| `leave_requests` | Yes | `lvr_` | [20260418_dm2_expand_leave_requests](prisma/migrations/20260418_dm2_expand_leave_requests) |
| `staffing_requests` | Yes | `stf_` | [20260418_dm2_expand_staffing_requests](prisma/migrations/20260418_dm2_expand_staffing_requests) |
| `staffing_request_fulfilments` | No (child) | — | [20260418_dm2_expand_staffing_request_fulfilments](prisma/migrations/20260418_dm2_expand_staffing_request_fulfilments) |
| `timesheet_weeks` | Yes | `tsh_` | [20260418_dm2_expand_timesheet_weeks](prisma/migrations/20260418_dm2_expand_timesheet_weeks) |
| `timesheet_entries` | No (child) | — | [20260418_dm2_expand_timesheet_entries](prisma/migrations/20260418_dm2_expand_timesheet_entries) |

Prefix reservations are captured in [schema-conventions.md §20](docs/planning/schema-conventions.md). `prisma validate` ✓ · `db:generate` ✓ · backend `tsc --noEmit` clean · schema lint baseline 364 (unchanged from pre-DM-2 batch; Skill-pilot's `publicId` was exempted via the `*Id$` lint heuristic fix). Fallback publicId format during expand is `<prefix>_<12-hex>`; DM-2.5-2 (Sqids service) will regenerate to proper opaque Sqids before the contract cutover.

**DM-2 remaining work:**
- **DM-2-ops-expand** — apply the 12 expand migrations to the blue/green clone → traffic replay → staging drill → production cutover. Any order works since expand is additive.
- **DM-2.5 tooling** — Sqids service, Prisma extension, NestJS pipe, serializer, the two new lint rules, controller+frontend migration top-down.
- **DM-2-contract-batch** — 12 contract migrations (PK swap + rename + drop trigger + `publicId NOT NULL`). Cross-table dependencies: `skills` ↔ `person_skills.skillId`, `timesheet_weeks` ↔ `timesheet_entries.timesheetWeekId`, `staffing_requests` ↔ `staffing_request_fulfilments.requestId` must contract in lock-step (type-mismatched FKs are invalid after cutover).
- **DM-2-finish** — regenerate `prisma/seed.ts`, unblock DM-3-2b (14 TEXT→UUID FKs), unblock DM-4 CHECK constraints on these tables, drop `id_old` shadow columns.

**Remaining DM sub-phases (pending):** DM-2 type normalization (expand-contract TEXT→uuid — unblocks DM-3 Phase-2's 14 remaining relations); DM-3 Phase-2 (TEXT→UUID FKs) + DM-3-6 service refactor (use Prisma `include`); DM-4 CHECK constraints + enum promotion + timestamptz conversion; DM-5 naming normalization; DM-6 new domain models (Currency, BudgetApproval, Contact, EmploymentEvent, ProjectRetrospective, dictionary-backed reference data); DM-7 DomainEvent transactional outbox + notification unification; DM-7.5 first-class tenant isolation with RLS; DM-8 version columns, soft-delete middleware, full-text search, materialised views, operational hardening.
- Missing notification events added (amended, deactivated, case approved/rejected)

### Accessibility (Phase 20e — complete)
- `prefers-reduced-motion` media query for all animations
- Native `<button>` in NotificationBell (was `<div>`)
- `scope="col"` on table headers across all pages
- Color contrast verified (--color-text-subtle darkened to 4.5:1)
- Focus-visible indicators on charts, tables, KPIs, tip balloons
- DataTable captions on key instances
- axe-core Playwright a11y test suite (`e2e/tests/14-accessibility.spec.ts`)

### UX improvements (Phase 20g — complete)
- Filter persistence via URL (CasesPage, WorkloadMatrixPage)
- Form pre-fill from URL params and auth context (CreateAssignment, CreateStaffingRequest, BulkAssignment)
- Timesheet approval auto-expands submitted rows (one-screen approval)
- Error/empty states all have forward actions
- Sort order persisted in URL (ProjectsPage)
- KPI drilldown fixed (TeamDashboard "Unassigned" links to filtered list)

### Frontend quality (Phase 20d)
- Disabled button styling for all variants
- Focus-visible on interactive table rows, KPI strip, chart wrappers
- Table row hover transitions
- Confirm dialog fade-in animation
- Inline styles extracted to constants in ActionDataTable and WorkloadMatrixPage
- Pagination component (`PaginationControls`) with page numbers, first/last, rows-per-page selector
- StaffingRequestsPage now paginated

### Completed 2026-04-11 (DB Migration & Demo Readiness)

- **In-memory → DB migration**: All persistent data stores moved to Prisma-backed repositories:
  - Notifications module (4 repos: Channel, Template, Request, Delivery)
  - Metadata module (new Prisma repos: MetadataDictionary, MetadataEntry)
  - Resource Pools module (new PrismaResourcePoolRepository)
  - Case management (CaseStep service now Prisma-backed; CaseComment stores in CaseRecord.payload JSON)
  - Audit observability (PrismaAuditLogStore writes to AuditLog table with in-memory cache for sync reads)
  - Kept in-memory: external system adapters (Jira, M365, Radius), webhooks (no Prisma model), CaseSLA config
- **Class-validator decorators**: Added to all 28 write DTO files across all modules
- **Comprehensive seed dataset** (phase2 profile): 32 people, 16 org units, 12 projects, 22 assignments, 24 evidence entries, 3 cases with 14 steps, 6 metadata dictionaries, 42 platform settings, 25 skills, 8 timesheet weeks, 36 pulse entries, 8 in-app notifications, 3 notification channels, 15 templates
- **Admin impersonation**: "View as..." dropdown in top header for admin users; overlays impersonated personId/roles onto `useAuth()` so all dashboards, role guards, and data fetching reflect the selected user
- **Auth fix**: `AuthenticatedPrincipalFactory` no longer throws on invalid/expired tokens — returns `undefined` so `@Public()` endpoints work regardless of stale tokens
- **Throttle limit**: Increased from 10 to 100 req/min globally; login endpoint keeps strict 10 req/min
- **Dashboard trend**: Sequential fetching (was 12 parallel calls hitting rate limit)
- **Scroll fix**: `.app-shell__content` changed to `overflow-y: auto`; `.page-container--viewport` no longer blocks scroll
- **Custom scrollbars**: 5px ultra-thin, color-matched for light content and dark sidebar
- **Sidebar fix**: Collapse button pinned at bottom; nav menu scrollable; duplicate key warning fixed
- **leave_requests migration**: Created and applied (table was missing from DB)
- **Monitoring fix**: Applied pending migration; fixed audit visibility false positive

### Completed 2026-04-08

- **15c-08**: Planned vs Actual page redesigned — tabbed summary table with expandable rows

## Workforce Planner — Distribution Studio (2026-04-17 / 18)

Entry point: `/staffing-desk?view=planner`. Backend: [workforce-planner.service.ts](src/modules/staffing-desk/application/workforce-planner.service.ts), [planner-scenario.service.ts](src/modules/staffing-desk/application/planner-scenario.service.ts), [staffing-desk.controller.ts](src/modules/staffing-desk/presentation/staffing-desk.controller.ts). Frontend: [WorkforcePlanner.tsx](frontend/src/components/staffing-desk/WorkforcePlanner.tsx) + 9 sibling components + [usePlannerSimulation.ts](frontend/src/features/staffing-desk/usePlannerSimulation.ts).

### Solver — strategy-driven auto-distribute

`POST /api/staffing-desk/planner/auto-match` accepts `{ strategy, minSkillMatch, from, weeks, projectStatuses[], priorities[], poolId, orgUnitId, demandIds?, lockedPersonIds? }`.

Five strategies:
- `BALANCED` (default): `0.5·skill + 0.3·benchDays + 0.2·costInverse`.
- `BEST_FIT`: pure skill match.
- `UTILIZE_BENCH`: longest-benched first, skill as tiebreaker.
- `CHEAPEST`: lowest cost, skill floor.
- `GROWTH`: stretch-band 20–60% skill, junior bonus.

Three-tier candidate selection per demand:
1. **Chain** — person whose prior simulated engagement ends strictly before this demand starts; preferred so one person rolls from project A to project B without going to bench.
2. **Qualified** — fresh bench person clearing `minSkillMatch`, ranked by strategy score.
3. **Fallback** — longest-bench eligible person regardless of skill (flagged `fallbackUsed: true`, shown as MISMATCH with `fallback: longest bench` rationale).

Hard filters applied in solver: `employmentStatus=ACTIVE`, over-allocation (cumulative across batch), approved leave overlap, project end date vs demand start.

### Multi-week coverage

Each suggestion carries `coverageWeeks: string[]` — Monday-aligned weeks spanning the demand's duration, clamped to the grid horizon. On acceptance, the frontend expands the suggestion into one yellow block per covered week. One suggestion can fill 13 cells.

### Filter consistency (grid + autoMatch + scenarios)

`projectStatuses` and `priorities` are passed to **both** `GET /api/staffing-desk/planner` and `POST /api/staffing-desk/planner/auto-match` from a single React state object. `poolId`/`orgUnitId` also flow to both. Project-status scope and the `endsOn >= horizonStart` guard are applied identically on both endpoints so any project invisible in the grid is also invisible to the solver.

Toolbar filter bar: `Status` multi-select chip (6 statuses, default ACTIVE), `Priority` multi-select chip (4 priorities, default all), `Layer` select (coverage/cost/match/risk heatmap).

### Diagnostics — transparent funnel

Every auto-match response carries an `AutoMatchDiagnostics` block: `projectsWithOpenDemand`, `projectsInScope`, `totalHeadcountScanned`, `headcountInScope`, `headcountSkippedProjectStatus`, `headcountSkippedHorizon`, `headcountSkippedPriority`, `totalActivePeople`, `benchInScope`, `suggestionsCreated`, `chainedCount`, `fallbackCount`, `unmatchedHeadcount`. Surfaced as a strip at the top of the preview modal so the user can reconcile the visible grid rows against the solver's scope.

### Extension & anomalies

`POST /api/staffing-desk/planner/extension-validate` runs 5 checks when a user opts to extend an existing assignment (`Extend` button in cell-detail popover): employment inactive, termination before new end, project end overrun (hard stops) + approved leave overlap, over-allocation (soft anomalies). Soft anomalies require a reason (`TRAINING | EMERGENCY | CLIENT_PREFERENCE | OTHER+note`); both the conflict list and the reason flow through apply and land on `ProjectAssignment.notes`.

Collapsible `PlannerAnomalyTable` below the grid aggregates: skill-mismatch force-assigns, over-allocation overrides, accepted MISMATCH auto-matches, extension conflicts. Default collapsed to a ~28px strip showing severity counts; expands on click to a capped 35vh scrollable table with per-row `Undo`. `flex: 0 0 auto` so it cannot steal vertical space from the grid.

### Server-persisted scenarios

New Prisma model `PlannerScenario` (`planner_scenarios` table, migration `20260418_add_planner_scenarios`) stores serialized simulation state (`moves`, `suggestions`, `hireIntents`, `releases`, `extensions`, `unmatchedDemand`) plus cached summary counts + horizon context.

- `GET /api/staffing-desk/planner/scenarios` — list
- `GET /api/staffing-desk/planner/scenarios/:id` — detail (includes `state`)
- `POST /api/staffing-desk/planner/scenarios` — create (requires `actorId`)
- `PATCH /api/staffing-desk/planner/scenarios/:id` — update
- `DELETE /api/staffing-desk/planner/scenarios/:id` — archive (soft)

Toolbar `Scenarios ▾` dropdown: Save current / Load / Fork / Archive. Forking round-trips through backend as a new record.

### Why-not?

`POST /api/staffing-desk/planner/why-not` — for any unmatched demand, returns top 5 close-but-rejected candidates with `disqualifiers: WhyNotDisqualifier[]` (`fully-allocated`, `on-leave`, `missing-skills`, `inactive`, ...). Surfaced via `?` button on each unmatched demand card in the bench sidebar.

### Cell rendering legend

- **Green fill** — existing APPROVED / ACTIVE / REQUESTED assignment.
- **Blue fill** — DRAFT assignment (`AssignmentStatus=DRAFT`).
- **Yellow dashed, no fill** — missing assignment (unfilled StaffingRequest / RolePlan HC).
- **Yellow fill** — proposed by simulation (auto-match accepted, manual drag, chained continuation).
- **Yellow dashed with ⟶** — simulated extension.
- **Purple dotted** — PHANTOM_HIRE (new hire intent, no person yet).
- `!` badge = skill MISMATCH; `⛔` badge = over-allocation override.

Cell cap: 6 assignments + 4 demands visible before a clickable **`+N more`** overflow badge opens the cell detail popover.

### Tuning controls

Bench sidebar: Strategy dropdown (5 options) + `Min skill match` slider (0–90%, step 5, default 15%). `Min skill match` is ignored when strategy is `GROWTH`.

### Apply flow

`POST /api/staffing-desk/planner/apply` now handles `{ dispatches, hireRequests, releases, extensions }` atomically:
- Dispatches create `ProjectAssignment` with `status=REQUESTED` and force-assign reason on `notes`.
- Hires create `StaffingRequest` with `status=OPEN`.
- Extensions update `ProjectAssignment.validTo` and append conflicts + reason to `notes`.
- Response: `{ assignmentsCreated, staffingRequestsCreated, releasesNoted, extensionsUpdated, errors[] }`.

### Interaction model

- Single click on a populated cell → `PlannerCellDetailPopover` (assignment list + per-row Remove/Extend/Release/Accept/Reject).
- Double click on any cell → `PlannerDraftAssignmentModal` (person picker from bench, Save Draft = `status=DRAFT`, Create & Request = `status=REQUESTED`).
- Drag bench → cell: classifies SUGGESTED/ACCEPTABLE/MISMATCH/BLOCKED; MISMATCH/BLOCKED triggers `PlannerForceAssignPopover` for reason capture.
- Inline bench chips appear on empty demand cells during Simulating mode (top-3 candidates, click = instant assign).
- Keyboard: `Cmd/Ctrl+Z` undo · `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` apply · `Escape` dismiss top overlay · `Alt+←/→` jump 4 weeks.
- Heatmap layers: coverage (default), cost, match quality, risk.

### Rightmost diff column

Every project row carries a sticky `Δ FTE` column showing `baseline → simulated` average FTE across the horizon and the delta, color-coded green/red/muted.

### Known limitations / follow-ups

- `PlannerAssignmentBlock` doesn't expose `validTo` to the frontend, so the Extend modal shows `open-ended` as the initial current-end; backend validator resolves the real date on first validate call.
- Compare-scenarios side-by-side view not built yet (only list + load + fork).
- Over-allocation tracking still uses a cumulative counter across the batch rather than per-week; acceptable because chaining uses `busyUntil` which naturally respects time windows, but fresh-bench over-allocation across multiple demand items in the same week is imprecise.
- No backend tests for the new solver paths yet — user has flagged test-runs as user-triggered only. Planner endpoints are exercised by the Playwright smoke suite but not by dedicated specs.
